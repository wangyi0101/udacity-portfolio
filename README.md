# [Project 1 - Portfolio](http://wangyi0101.github.io/udacity-portfolio/)

This portfolio responsive website [(visit here)](http://wangyi0101.github.io/udacity-portfolio/) is my first Udacity Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree project. In this project I replicated a design mockup in HTML and CSS, and added a carousel and modals to personalize the page design. The techniques that I used include:

* Bootstrap gribs system and Bootstrap carousel
* Responsive image with Bootstrap's `img-responsive` calssï¼Œ`picture` element, `source` element and `srcset` attribute
* Typography responsive
* Grunt to optimize images
